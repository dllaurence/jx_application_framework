Hmm, an interesting point, and one that I had not considered.

It may be relevant here that the tentative copyright notice for my new
package softens this requirement, asking that credit be given where
possible, but not requiring it.  (I had originally intended to keep the
terms unchanged, but some folks were willing to supply money on condition
that it be loosened...)

Hmmmmmm.  I think my preferred rule of thumb would be that credit should
be in proportion to visibility.  If you spend a page or two of docs
explaining what REs are and how to use them, credit should appear.  If REs
get a one-line mention, credit is optional, perhaps via a cross-reference
to something else.  If they are strictly an internal tool and are not
visible to the customer, internals documentation (if any) should mention
them, but credit need not appear in customer documentation.

That's my first reaction.  It's an area I hadn't thought about before;
I'm open to discussion if there are difficulties..

It would be relevant to users of the code, of course, but we'd still honor
the request as well as provide all the info to the library users so it
doesn't matter to us directly.

Why would someone care particularly about giving attribution?

That seems reasonable.  We'll give credit ourselves for the library and
ask that client applications give credit where the regexes are visible.
For example (as I would interpret it) if the regexes are strictly internal
to JX and the programmer isn't manipulating them directly, the credits for
the JX library are sufficient.  If the programmer is manipulating regexes
directly but it is invisible to users, the source should include the
credits.  If they are visible to users, then the documentation itself
should provide credits.  Is that a fair paraphrase of what you had in
mind?

I don't see any problem with that--and if someone objects to having to
give credit for some unfathomable reason I guess someone already paid cash
so that everyone can do this.

I am quite comfortable with the idea of retroactively applying the new
rules to the old package, if that makes life easier for you folks.

No, nothing specific...  Your wording sounds fine to me.

(The reason the replies to this and related messages were delayed was
not discomfort with the issue, but a series of crises, culminating in the 
abrupt death of my system disk...  I'm catching up on mail while waiting
for repair work to finish.)

Certainly. If you distribute it from a web page, please include a
link to the ctags site (http://darren.hiebert.com/ctags) so it is
clear where to go in case someone wants to obtain the "official"
distribution (or an update). Also, please give me the URL from where
you distribute it and I will include a link to your site on the
ctags site.
