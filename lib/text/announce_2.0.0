Followup-To: comp.os.linux.misc

JX 2.0.0 is now available.  It features support for European languages, a
string database manager to support translation without recompiling, support
for the new XSearch protocol (http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/xsearch/), a
fully redesigned interface to the X Selection mechanism, and significant
optimizations to JTable.  In addition, JXHelpManager allows the user to
search all the on-line help sections, thereby alleviating the need to
provide an index.

A new add-on library, libjfs, is also available.  The provides a "binding
manager" so the user can decide which program to use for each type of file.
By using libjfs, all JX programs can share the same bindings.

Thanks to:

  * David Sauer and Tor Sigurdsson for helping me implement full support
    for European languages.
  * Mike Lockwood for the OpenBSD port.
  * Patrick D. Berge and John F. Bleichert for patches to the AIX port.
  * Joan Bertran for helping eliminate unnecessary network traffic caused
    by Xlib.
  * Igor Khristophorov for discovering the reason why makemake hangs in
    certain situation.  Check the FAQ for details.
  * Oleg Sinitsin for pushing forward the work on compiling with CC.

Description:

JX is a full-featured C++ application framework and GUI class library for
X.  The power of JX stems from its rich feature set and extensibility which
support all aspects of professional quality application development.

The features built into JX include a generic messaging system to support
the Model-View-Controller paradigm, document management and interaction,
Drag-And-Drop, 3D graphics, networking (e.g. INET and UNIX sockets), the
ability to connect to multiple X displays, configurable button toolbars, a
powerful word processor class, very extensive table support, a 2D plotting
package, hypertext help, seamlessly integrated postscript printing, and a
memory manager to help track down memory leaks.

This rich feature set does not impede the extensibility of the system,
however.  The base class for all GUI objects, the Widget, provides
mechanisms for supporting all of the actions and interactions that are
expected in today's commercial applications.  In addition, it is easy to
derive customized classes from almost any class in the library, from the
base Widget class to specialized classes such as Tables and Menus.

JX is designed to make it easy to construct commercial quality
applications.  All the common, required functionality is built in, so
developers need only connect the standard components together and then
develop custom Widgets that are unique to their particular applications.

JX is very close to providing the same feature set as the awe-inspiring
Galaxy application framework, our source is available, and we're free for
non-commercial use and a lot cheaper than Galaxy for commercial
development!  We're not yet cross-platform, but we have begun work on the
Windows 95/98/NT port.  If you are interested in how a particular feature
of Galaxy is provided by JX, please contact us.
