JX 1.1.19 (the latest cutting-edge version) is now available.  The license
has been rewritten to explicitly allow patches to be distributed, as
required by the Open Source model.

Thanks to the following people for porting JX:

    FreeBSD            Ivan Pascal
    HP-UX 10.20        Sergio Ricci
    Solaris            Peter Gross at SignalSoft Corp

JX also compiles on egcs 1.1, though the thunks bug is still there.
(http://www.its.caltech.edu/~jafl/jx/egcs_bug.html)

Yet another add on library is also available.  J2DPlot allows you to easily
plot both data and functions within your own programs.

JX 1.1.19 is now very close to providing the same feature set as the
awe-inspiring Galaxy application framework, and our source is available,
and we're free for non-commercial use and a lot cheaper than Galaxy for
commercial development!  We're not yet cross-platform, but we have begun
work on the Windows 95/98/NT port.  If you are interested in how a
particular feature of Galaxy is provided by JX, please contact us.

The binary and source distributions can be downloaded from:

Description:

JX is a full-featured C++ application framework and GUI class library for
X.  The power of JX stems from its rich feature set and extensibility which
support all aspects of professional quality application development.

The features built into JX include a generic messaging system to support
the Model-View-Controller paradigm, document management and interaction,
Drag-And-Drop, 3D graphics, networking (e.g. INET and UNIX sockets), the
ability to connect to multiple X displays, a powerful word processor class,
very extensive table support, background tasks, and seamlessly integrated
postscript printing.

This rich feature set does not impede the extensibility of the system,
however.  The base class for all GUI objects, the Widget, provides
mechanisms for supporting all of the actions and interactions that are
expected in today's commercial applications.  In addition, it is easy to
derive customized classes from almost any class in the library, from the
base Widget class to specialized classes such as Tables and Menus.

JX is designed to make it easy to construct commercial quality
applications.  All the common, required functionality is built in, so
developers need only connect the standard components together and then
develop custom Widgets that are unique to their particular applications.
