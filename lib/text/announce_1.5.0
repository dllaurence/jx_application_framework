Followup-To: comp.os.linux.misc

JX 1.5.0 (the latest cutting-edge version) is now available.  The only real
change is support for 64-bit architectures.  The version number change is
long overdue.  I did it now simply to get it done.

Thanks to the following people for porting JX:

  Digital UNIX (OSF1)    Xuejun Cai
  IRIX 5.3               Isaac Stoddard

Description:

JX is a full-featured C++ application framework and GUI class library for
X.  The power of JX stems from its rich feature set and extensibility which
support all aspects of professional quality application development.

The features built into JX include a generic messaging system to support
the Model-View-Controller paradigm, document management and interaction,
Drag-And-Drop, 3D graphics, networking (e.g. INET and UNIX sockets), the
ability to connect to multiple X displays, configurable button toolbars, a
powerful word processor class, very extensive table support, a 2D plotting
package, hypertext help, seamlessly integrated postscript printing, and a
memory manager to help track down memory leaks.

This rich feature set does not impede the extensibility of the system,
however.  The base class for all GUI objects, the Widget, provides
mechanisms for supporting all of the actions and interactions that are
expected in today's commercial applications.  In addition, it is easy to
derive customized classes from almost any class in the library, from the
base Widget class to specialized classes such as Tables and Menus.

JX is designed to make it easy to construct commercial quality
applications.  All the common, required functionality is built in, so
developers need only connect the standard components together and then
develop custom Widgets that are unique to their particular applications.

JX is very close to providing the same feature set as the awe-inspiring
Galaxy application framework, our source is available, and we're free for
non-commercial use and a lot cheaper than Galaxy for commercial
development!  We're not yet cross-platform, but we have begun work on the
Windows 95/98/NT port.  If you are interested in how a particular feature
of Galaxy is provided by JX, please contact us.
