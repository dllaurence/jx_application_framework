JXMenu::PrepareToOpenMenu()
	itsOwner may delete us!

Docking
	medic dock all windows:  resize causes crash because compartments do not conform to min sizes
	Gnome/fvwm2 sometimes require dock/undock/dock to get it positioned correctly
		is this because JX doesn't give WM time to make adjustments?
	Gnome docking:
		window sometimes remains on desktop without border
		dock window moves when drag window from docking compartment with
			other windows to empty docking compartment
			Appears to be because Raise() is called twice in a row on the JXDockDirector

Dock
	When compartment minimized and move tab position, should readjust pane sizes
	When min page size increases in dock, adjust panes so divider visible
		(test:  move tab group tabs from side to top)

	JXWindow:
		ignore hide and iconify for docked windows
		Before docking, show and deiconify
	doesn't work correctly when "all docked" and show iconified window
		(e.g., file list)

	When drag in testjx Dock #3, ghost drawing from something

arrow
	fix SaveState() so it doesn't need JFileArray
	specify timeout for lockfile and handle it as lock failure

svn_client:
	Input field on every action tab
		wrapper widget creates JXScrollbarSet and input field
		when set process + fd, show input
		when process finished, hide input

jcc:
	multi-project

buzzer:
	merge code from Glenn and get it to build

leibnitz
	finish 3D plotting

multi-pane editing:
	split off itsBuffer,itsStyles,itsUndo/RedoList into JTextBuffer
	leave recalc engine, cursor location, and other display stuff in JTextEditor
	JTextEditor can be constructed from string or JTextBuffer
	CBTextEditor has handle to {JTextBuffer, refCount}
	Edit menu has "New view..." which opens another CBTextEditor and incr refCount
	When close, only require save if refCount == 1
	Active undo needs to know which view it is for
		since event from another view needs to deactivate it and create new one

Clean up prefs
	JXPrefsDialog has tree list and card file
		tree list pane adjusts width to bounds of tree list
		card file pane sets min size to union of card sizes
	Split CBTextEditorPrefs into multiple panes
	factor out JXEditStylesWidget from JXEditStylesDialog so it can be a card

Dock
	Key shortcuts to move between dock compartments
		What key?  Tab is fully loaded in jcc
		cycle through leaf nodes of tree from left to right
		(first, build array of leaf nodes, then find current pane and switch to next)

medic:
	Same prefs menu in all windows
	set commands when restore breakpoints
		need to store commands

	Add forward and backward buttons/menus
	Middle-click on link => new window
	Right-click on link => menu
		"Open %k Left-click | Open in new window %k Middle-click"

JPrefsManager:
	Atomic lock around SaveToDisk(), etc. in case multiple instances try writing

When search for something in CVS output window, doesn't hilight selection
until wheel-mouse scroll.

When cvs diff is run in directory with .jcc file, loses data from middle of
.jcc contents to some later point -- only seen on work machine, and only
with old single, line format

-----

Class trees need to search symbol database for function location.

jcc project: mark as needs save
	CBProjectTree:  all changes
	CBCommandManager:  all changes to MakeDependCmd or cmd list
	CBBuildManager:  makefile method, etc.
	CTree:  changes to C preprocessor
	Tree:  changes to search dirs

jcc takes a long time to figure out that a 251MB file is large enough to
warn about -- is the underlying code somehow reading the file to figure out
how big it is?

JMDIServer:
	use TCP socket instead of UNIX socket
	write file in /tmp with pid and local port

Windows:
	Replace S_ISLNK with check for .lnk
	Test usage of R/W/X_OK
	Replace X_OK and S_IXUSR with check for .exe/.com?
	Build source distr
		generate *L.cpp & *Y.cpp before taring source
		update misc/win32/regex.h
	Test JStringMapDelete & JPtrArrayCopy

jcc
	perl:  = 2 ?
		Delete 2, type 2 => styles are wrong to next ?
		Same with /, because both are regex constructs
		Need to restyle further?

SystemG:
	trash must remember where each file came from
		~/.trash/.source stores list of original locations
		cull non-existent when re-write the file
		delete when empty trash

EditCommandsDialog:
	$? - prompt user for value before running

docking:
	Move menu bars to top of dock
		Director registers menubar with JXWindow
		Reparent menubar widget
		Shift all other widgets up and resize window without calling BoundsChanged()

JTextEditor::DrawInMargin
	line #'s
	bookmarks

Char set:
	preserve modified char set when font changes

Could use SIP to generate Python bindings?

XML editor
	xmltree_source-1.0.0.tar.gz

	What my program does is parse the xml and create a tree of nodes whose
	styles are contextual. Clicking on a node takes you to that line in
	jcc. The are two other cmd-click operations that take you to the end of
	the xml node or that select the entire node.
	
	Xml is just text, so it just didn't make sense to me to create a new
	different sort of text editor. I thought this approach made sense.

	For pure XML, it makes more sense to edit directly in the tree,
	however.

	For the stuff I was doing, writing docbook stuff, the current method
	seemed to make the most sense. If it is just simple strings, however, I
	can imagine that it would make more sense to deal with it inline. You
	might want to keep in mind what I needed it for so whatever changes you
	make still make sense in that context. For example, if I'm editing in
	jcc and I make a change in the xml editor, do I need to reload the file
	in jcc?

	I'll make separate types for XML formatted text and pure XML.  The
	former will use your method, while the latter will stick to the tree.

	Once integrated, the former method will rebuild the XML tree when the
	text changes.  This is manual in the current version.

theme:
	each widget looks for its function in all loaded theme dlls
		start with JXButton
	jXGlobals loads all ddls in theme directory that start with theme ID
	http://www.newplanetsoftware/jx/theme.php

JStringManager must take JStringID = char*
	convert all static strings to JStringManager
	convert all string ID's to JStringID
	convert all JBroadcaster message types to JMessageID
	allows redefining JCharacter to wchar_t

widget factory:
	JX defines function pointer and sets it to JX widget factory
	other library installs its function pointer and saves original => linked list
object model:
	query available values on any object
	query value by name on any object
	object constructor initializes hash table of get/set function pointers
		in base class JXWidget
	need generalized object to contain values for get/set

-----

CBTreeDirector:
	ReceiveWithFeedback:  include src file for C++
Editor for regex's so compiler support is not hard-coded
Cascade option for undocked windows
Option to search all files in current project
Symbol list: print unique prefix for file names (like in Files window)
PHP: balance <? ?>
JXChooseMonoFont: allow "Other..."
