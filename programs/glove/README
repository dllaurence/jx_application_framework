Glove was designed as a flexible tool to address a number of issues. We
needed a generic plotting tool, an interface to data acquisition systems,
sophisticated (and correct) statistical analysis, and the ability to easily
and intuitively manipulate the data we had.

The on-line help explains all the features of the program.
