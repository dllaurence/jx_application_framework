If Glove crashes or if you find other bugs, please check the web
page first to see if they have already been reported.


Notes on Glove:

Glove was designed as a flexible tool to address a number of issues. We
needed a generic plotting tool, an interface to data acquisition systems,
sophisticated (and correct) statistical analysis, and the ability to easily
and intuitively manipulate the data we had.
