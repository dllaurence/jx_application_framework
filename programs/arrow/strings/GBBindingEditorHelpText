<h3>Binding Editor</h3>
 
The bindings editor window lets you specify how files and programs work 
together. For example, you might specify that any file ending in 
<i>.ps</i>, which is normally a postcript file, should be opened by the gv 
program.
 
<p>
 
The bindings editor contains three columns. The first column contains 
either a file ending (ie. <i>.ps</i>), or <i><default></i>. The second and 
third columns contain programs to run when the specified files are opened. 
The program listed in the second column is the default program, while the 
program listed in the third column is the alternate program, which is 
invoked if the user holds the <i>Meta</i> key down while double-clicking on 
the file. In the two action columns, <i>%f</i> refers to the file that was 
opened. So for the above postscript example, the file ending would be 
listed as <i>.ps</i> and the <i>Action</i> would be listed as <i>gv %f</i>.
 
<p>
 
When you want to add another file type, click on the <i>New</i> button. 
This will create a new column which you can fill in. You then click in the 
action columns to edit their values.
 
<p>
 
When you have finished editing the file bindings, you can either click the 
<i>Revert</i> button, which will return the bindings to what they were when 
you started, or press the <i>Save</i> button, which will save your changes.
