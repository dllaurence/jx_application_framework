<h3>Main Window</h3>

The main window displays the list of running processes.  You can sort by the values in a column by clicking the column title.
<p>
By default, only your own processes are shown.  You can change this, by turning on \"Show processes for all users.\"
<p>
The leftmost column shows the status of each process.  A green dot indicates the the process is running.  A red dot indicates that the process is paused.  You can change the state by clicking the dot.  An X indicates that the process is a \"zombie.\"  This means that the process is dead, but has not yet been cleaned up by the system.
<p>
You can right-click on a process in the list for a menu of actions.
<p>
Ending a process is the nice way to do it.  It gives the process a chance to clean up.  Killing a process is the brutal way.  This should only be done if the the process refuses to end nicely.
<p>
Re-nicing a process lowers its priority so it only gets a chance to work when other processes are idle."
