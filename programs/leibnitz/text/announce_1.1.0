THX-1138 1.1.0 is now available.  This release doubles the precision of the
calculator to 16 digits and adds the ability to print the plots to EPS files.

Description:

While quite appropriate for a hand held device, the bunch-o-buttons
interface provided by a typical calculator is ridiculous when implemented
on a computer screen.  Instead, THX-1138 provides an approximation to
electronic paper.  As you enter the expression, it is displayed the way you
would write it on paper, and you can edit it directly.

You can also plot functions and print the graphs as PostScript, and there
is a window for base conversions. (e.g. hex <-> decimal)
