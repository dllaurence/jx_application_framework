<h3> Plotting 2D Functions </h3>

When you select \"Plot 2D function...\" from a menu, you will first get a dialog
asking you to enter the function to plot.  The independent variable is called
x, so for example, to plot the sine function, you would enter sin(x).
<p>
The menu lets you specify whether to create a new graph or to add the curve
to an existing graph.  The existing graphs are listed by displaying their
titles.
<p>
The curve name is the initial name that will be associated with the curve in
the graph's legend.  If you leave this empty, it will be set to the function itself.
<p>
The initial range is the range to use when first displaying the curve.
Once the graph is created, you can zoom in or out as far as you wish.

<h3> Changing the appearance of a graph </h3>

You can change the scale of the graph in several ways.  The \"Change scale...\"
item on the Options menu opens a dialog for changing the axes ranges and switching
between linear and logarithmic scales.  Double-clicking on either axis also
opens this dialog.  Clicking and dragging inside the graph's frame zooms in
to show the selected region.  If you hold down the Meta key,
a nice looking scale will be chosen around the area of interest.  To return
the scale to the initial setting, select \"Reset scale\" from the Options menu.
<p>
To change the other settings for a curve, either select \"Change curve options...\"
from the Options menu or double-click on the appropriate curve label in the
legend.
<p>
You can edit the graph's title and axis labels by either selecting \"Change
labels...\" from the Options menu or double-clicking on the text.
<p>
The range specifies what portion of the curves will be drawn.  This is useful
if you need to use a particular scale, but only want to show the function over
a part of the scale.  \"Copy scale to range\" sets the range to the current scale,
so when you zoom out, the portion of the curve that is drawn remains the same.
\"Change range...\" opens a dialog so you can set the range directly.  \"Clear
range\" clears the range so the curves are always drawn to fill the window.
<p>
Cursors help you estimate the position of various features on a curve.  To move
a cursor, simply click on it and then either drag it around or use the arrow keys.
Holding down the Meta key while using the arrow keys makes the cursor move faster.
If you turn on \"Dual cursors,\" the values of both cursors will be displayed
along with the distance between them.  \"Mark cursor\" saves the position of the
selected cursor in the Cursor Mark Values window and also draws a gray line at the
position so you can find it on the graph.

<h3> Miscellaneous </h3>

Plot windows have their WM_CLASS set to Leibnitz_Plot.  This can be used
to filter these windows out of a window manager's taskbar.
