<h3> Base Conversion </h3>

The Base Conversion window lets you convert between base 2, 8, 10, and 16.
Simply enter the starting value in the text field corresponding to the original
base and the values in all the other bases will be displayed automatically.
You can copy the text in any text field with the keyboard shortcut Meta-C.
<p>
The <a href=jxhelp:THXExprHelp>Expression</a> window also accepts hexadecimal values
prefixed by <tt>0x</tt>, so you can convert from hex to decimal by simply typing
the number and pressing return.
