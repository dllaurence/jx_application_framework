<h3> Plotting 3D Functions </h3>

When you select \"Plot 3D function...\" from a menu, you will first get a dialog
asking you to enter the function to plot.  The independent variables are called
x and y, so for example, to plot a sine function, you would enter sin(x*y).
<p>
The surface name becomes the title of the window.  If you leave this empty, it will be set to the function itself.
<p>
The initial range is the range to use when first displaying the surface.
Once the graph is created, you can zoom in or out.

<h3> Changing the appearance of a graph </h3>

To change the function, the range, or the sampling grid, select \"Edit function...\" from the Options menu.  Each of the axes is fixed to show [-5,+5].  You can specify any range you want and simply zoom out to see more.
<p>
Use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out.  Click and drag to rotate the plot around the origin.  Resizing the window will make the image larger.

<h3> Miscellaneous </h3>

Plot windows have their WM_CLASS set to Leibnitz_Plot.  This can be used
to filter these windows out of a window manager's taskbar.
