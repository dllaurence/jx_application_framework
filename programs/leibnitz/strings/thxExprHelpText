<h3> The Expression Window </h3>

The Expression window provides a simple, yet powerful interface for entering
and evaluating algebraic expressions.  The top half of the window displays
the expression, while the bottom half displays a history of the expressions
that have been evaluated, called the tape.
<p>
At the right is the keypad that you can use to enter simple expressions.
This works just like a hand held calculator.  \"Clear\" clears the value
that you are entering, while \"Clear all\" clears the entire expression.
Once you have mastered the keyboard interface described below, you will
probably want to hide the keypad by turning off the \"Show keypad\" option
on the Preferences menu.
<p>
The Close button in the upper right corner closes the window and discards
the expression and the contents of the tape.  When you quit, all the existing
windows are saved, so you can start right where you left off when you run
the program again later.
<p>
Expression windows have their WM_CLASS set to Leibnitz_Expression.  This can be used
to filter these windows out of a window manager's taskbar.

<h3> Entering Expressions </h3>

The simplest way to explain the interface is that you just type as if you
were entering a text expression.  The expression will be built graphically as
you type.
<p>
New expressions are initally empty.  This is drawn as a single question mark (?),
which represents an empty input field.  When you click on the input field, it becomes
active, and you are ready to start typing.
<p>
Input fields accept numbers and the named constants defined in the
<a href=jxhelp:THXConstantsHelp>Constants</a> window.  When you type an operator,
the input field is parsed and becomes part of the expression, and a new input
field is created based on which operator you typed.  The operators are as follows:

<pre>
   +  addition
   -  subtraction
   *  multiplication
   /  division
   ^  exponentiation
   |  parallel combination:  x||y = x*y/(x+y)
</pre>

You actually only need to type a unique prefix of a named constant because the
editor will complete it for you automatically when parsing it.
<p>
While entering a number, typing \"e\" lets you enter the exponent.
<p>
Input fields also accept certain pre-defined constants:

<pre>
   pi = 3.141592654...
   e  = 2.718281828...
   i  = sqrt(-1)
   j  = sqrt(-1) (for Electrical Engineers)
</pre>

You can also enter the names of pre-defined functions.  The function name is parsed
when you type a left parenthesis \"(\".  You can also use the \"Apply function\"
submenu on the Math menu if you don't remember the name of the function that you
need.

<pre>
   sqrt       square root
   abs        absolute value
   sign       algebraic sign (+1, -1)
   round      nearest integer
   truncate   toss fractional part

   log        logarithm to an arbitrary base
   log10      logarithm base 10
   ln         natural logarithm
   log2       logarithm base 2

   sin        sine
   cos        cosine
   tan        tangent
   arcsin     inverse sine
   arccos     inverse cosine
   arctan     inverse tangent(x) (-<font face=Symbol>p</font>/2 to +<font face=Symbol>p</font>/2)
   arctan2    inverse tangent(y,x) (-<font face=Symbol>p</font> to +<font face=Symbol>p</font>)

   sinh       hyperbolic sine
   cosh       hyperbolic cosine
   tanh       hyperbolic tangent
   arcsinh    inverse hyperbolic sine
   arccosh    inverse hyperbolic cosine
   arctanh    inverse hyperbolic tangent

   re         real part
   im         imaginary part
   arg        phase angle
   conjugate  complex conjugate
   rotate     rotate(complex number, angle to rotate in degrees)

   max        maximum of its arguments
   min        minimum of its arguments
   parallel   parallel combination: x||y = x*y/(x+y)
</pre>

The last three functions can take an arbitrary number of arguments.
Typing a comma ( , ) adds another argument.
<p>
While entering an expression, the return key, the space bar, and the right
parenthesis \")\" all parse the current input field and then select it.
The spacebar and the right parenthesis will extend the
selection \"upwards\" when pressed again.  This allows you to enter an
expression like <tt>x^2+1</tt> without using the mouse by typing <tt>x ^ 2 space
space + 1</tt>
<p>
Selecting a piece of the expression lets you manipulate it using the Math menu.
The \"Apply function\" submenu transfers the selection to the first argument of the function
that you select from the menu.
<p>
The Backspace key replaces the selection with an input field.  Typing Backspace again
deletes the input field.  Typing an operator applies it to the selection.  Typing
other text replaces the selection with an input field.
<p>
Double clicking on a number or a named constant lets you edit it.
<p>
There can be more than one empty input field in an expression.  A question mark
is used to represent each one.  The Tab key moves you from one input field to another.

<h3> Using the clipboard </h3>

When you copy an expression to the clipboard, you can paste it into any other
program to obtain a textual version of the expression.  You can also copy
an expression in this form from another program and paste it into any Expression
window.
