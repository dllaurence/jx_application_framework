If the directory is managed by git, the Git menu will be enabled.  The first item tells you the current branch and provides a menu of the locally available branches.  Selecting one of these items will switch your directory contents to that branch.
<p>
\"Status...\" displays the status of the current branch.  By default, <code>git citool</code> is used.  You can change this in the Preferences dialog.
<p>
\"History...\" displays the history of the current branch.  By default, <code>gitk</code> is used.  You can change this in the Preferences dialog.
<p>
\"Commit all changes...\" commits <em>all</em> changes, both staged and unstaged, but does not include unmanaged files.  To commit only some changes, use either <code>git citool</code> (via the \"Status...\" item) or <code>git commit</code> (in a terminal).
<p>
\"Revert all changes\" discards all changes made to tracked files, both staged and unstaged.
<p>
\"Fetch &amp; merge from remote\" displays a list of remote repositories.  Selecting an item retrieves the latest from that repository and merges it into your working copy.
<p>
\"Push current branch to remote\" displays a list of remote repositories.  Selecting an item pushes the committed changes in the current branch to that repository.
<p>
\"Merge from local branch\" displays a list of local branches.  Selecting an item merges the contents of that branch into the current branch.
<p>
\"Fetch remote branch\" displays a list of remote branches.  Selecting an item pulls the contents of that branch into the local repository.
<p>
\"Create local branch...\" will create a new branch and switch to it.  The initial contents of the branch will be copied from the previously selected branch.
<p>
\"Remove local branch\" displays a list of local branches.  Selecting an item deletes that branch from the local repository.
