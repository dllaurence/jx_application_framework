<h3> Folder icons </h3>

A folder, also called a directory, contains a collection of files and other folders.  The icon for a folder is drawn differently depending on the <a href=jxhelp:SyGFileHelp#Permissions>permissions</a>.  If you are not allowed to write to the folder, e.g., to create new files, the folder's tab will be black.  If you are not allowed to see the contents of the folder, there will not be an arrow to the left of the icon, and there will be a belt around the folder itself.

<h3> Opening a folder </h3>

System G supports several ways of opening a folder in order to accommodate the various ways that people have of navigating through the file system.
<p>
The most basic way to open a folder is by double clicking on it.  This will open the folder in a separate window.
<p>
You can also open a folder with the \"Open\" command in the File menu.  If a folder is selected, System G will open that folder.  If nothing is selected, an open dialog box will prompt you for a folder to open.

<p>
Here is the complete list of all the ways to open a folder:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> Double-click on folder
<dt> Meta-O (\"Open\" on File menu)
<dt> Meta-Down-arrow
<dd> Open the folder in a new window.
<p>
<dt> Meta-double-click on folder
<dt> Meta-Shift-O (\"Alternate open\" on File menu)
<dt> Meta-Shift-Down-arrow
<dd> Open the folder in the same window.
<p>
<dt> Ctrl-double-click on folder
<dt> Ctrl-O (\"Open ... and close this\" on File menu)
<dd> Open the folder in a new window, and close the current window.
<p>
<dt> Ctrl-Shift-double-click on folder
<dt> Ctrl-Shift-O (\"Open ... and iconify this\" on File menu)
<dd> Open the folder in a new window, and iconify the current window.
<p>
<br>
<dt> Meta-Up-arrow
<dd> Open the enclosing folder in a new window.
<p>
<dt> Meta-Shift-Up-arrow
<dd> Open the enclosing folder in the same window.
<p>
<dt> Click and hold on the folder icon in lower left of window
<dd> Open menu to select ancestor folder.  (Hold down the Meta key when selecting a folder to avoid opening a new window.)
<p>
<br>
<dt> Click on triangle when folder is closed
<dt> Right-arrow
<dd> Open the folder to display its contents below its name.
<p>
<dt> Click on triangle when folder is open
<dt> Left-arrow
<dd> Close the folder.
<p>
<dt> Meta-click on triangle when folder is closed
<dt> Meta-Right-arrow
<dd> Open the folder to display its contents and the contents of sub-folders.
<p>
<dt> Meta-click on triangle when folder is open
<dt> Meta-Left-arrow
<dd> Close the folder and all sub-folders.  (If you only close the folder itself, the sub-folders will remain open and their contents will be visible next time you open the folder.)
<p>
<dt> Shift-click on triangle when folder is closed
<dt> Shift-Right-arrow
<dd> Open all folders to display their contents below their names.
<p>
<dt> Shift-click on triangle when folder is open
<dt> Shift-Left-arrow
<dd> Close all folders.
<p>
<br>
<dt> Middle-double-click on folder
<dd> Run an arbitrary command with the folder name as an argument.
</dl>
</blockquote>

The keyboard shortcuts obviously only work when one or more folders are selected.
<p>
Notice the similarities between these shortcuts and those for opening files and running programs.

<p>
You can add folders to the Shortcut menu to allow direct access to them.

<p>
Running System G from the command-line opens all of the folders that were opened when you last quit the program (if they still exist). Once it is running, you can also call System G from the command-line with arguments to open other folders. This will not create a new instance of System G, but will pass the arguments to the currently running instance which will open the requested folders. If no arguments are specified on the command-line, System G will open the current working directory.

<a name=Creating>

<h3>Creating folders</h3>

You can create a new folder by selecting the \"New folder\" command from the File menu. If nothing is selected, a folder will be created in the current folder. If a file is created, a folder will be created in the folder containing that file. If a folder is created, a folder will be created within that folder.

<a name=Views>

<h3> View options </h3>

There are several file properties that can be shown in the window by selecting the appropriate menu item in the Views menu. The properties available are <i>user</i>, <i>group</i>, <i>size</i>, <i>permissions</i>, and <i>date</i>. Selecting \"Show hidden\" from the View menu will show all of the hidden files with their properties as well.

<a name=Filters>

<h3> Filters </h3>

There are times when there are too many files visible, making it hard to find a particular file or group of files. The filter field is helpful in this. The filter is made visible by selecting \"Show filter\" from the View menu. The files are filtered based on the pattern in the filter field. Patterns are constructed by replacing letters or groups of letters in a file name with a '*'. For example, \*.cc\ displays all files the end in \.cc\.

<a name=Shortcuts>

<h3> The Shortcuts menu </h3>

Shortcuts provide a way to quickly access a folder. Once you have opened a folder that you will be opening frequently, you can add it to the shortcut list by selecting the \"Add shortcut\" from the Shortcuts menu.  Later when you wish to open that folder, simply select it from the list in the Shortcuts menu.
<p>
The Shortcuts menu always includes the mount points corresponding to floppy disks, CDROM's, ZIP and JAZ disks, Windows partitions, etc.  If you select one of these items, System G will automatically try to mount the disk if it isn't already mounted.  When you close the window, System G will automatically try to unmount the disk if it wasn't mounted before its window was opened.  This allows you to insert a disk, open the window in System G, do whatever you want, close the window, and then <em>safely</em> remove the disk.  The only caveat for this to work is that you must leave the window open until you are completely finished with the disk.  If you are editing files on the disk, have other windows open for folders on the disk, etc., then System G will not be able to unmount the disk when you close its window.  (You can always open the window again and use the \"Unmount\" item on the File menu.)

<a name=GitBranch>

<h3> Working with Git </h3>

If the directory is managed by git, the Branch menu will be displayed.  The first group of items is the locally available branches.  Selecting one of these items will switch your directory contents to that branch.  The second group of items, displayed in white, are the remote branches.  Selecting one of these will download the branch so you can work with it.
<p>
\"Create branch...\" will create a new branch and switch to it.  The initial contents of the branch will be copied from the previously selected branch.
<p>
\"Status...\" displays the status of the current branch.  By default, <code>git citool</code> is used.  You can change this in the Preferences dialog.
<p>
\"Commit all changes...\" commits <em>all</em> changes, both staged and unstaged.  To commit only some changes, use either <code>git citool</code> or <code>git commit</code>.
<p>
\"Revert all changes\" discards all changes made to tracked files, both staged and unstaged.
<p>
\"Fetch &amp; merge from\" displays a list of remote repositories.  Selecting an item retrieves the latest from that repository and merges it into your working copy.
<p>
\"Push current branch to\" displays a list of remote repositories.  Selecting an item pushes the committed changes in the current branch to that repository.
