<title>Getting started with System G</title>
</head>

System G is a simple file manager that provides basic access to the file system. The goal is to allow a simple way to access and manipulate files and folders. Files and folders are opened by double-clicking on them, names are changed by clicking on them and then typing in the new name, permissions are changed by clicking on the appropriate permission, etc.

<p>

Running System G for the first time will open your home directory. You can then navigate through your files by using the \"Open\" command in the File menu, or double-clicking on a directory. If you open a directory that you expect to access frequently, you can add it to the shortcut list, by choosing \"Add shortcut\" from the Shortcuts menu.

<p>

As an example of the ease of use of System G, let's suppose that you needed to edit the name of a file in a particular directory. You would first use the \"Open\" command (or Meta-O), and select the appropriate directory, then you would start typing the letters in the old name, which would locate the file in the directory and select it. If you then hit the Return key, the file name would become editable. You then type in the new name and press the Return key again.
